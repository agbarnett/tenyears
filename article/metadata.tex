\def \articleABSTRACT{Taking the ReScience Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge, I tried to reproduce my own code from a paper published in 2004 that estimated the trend and seasonality in coronary heart disease in multiple countries. The original SAS code and text data were relatively easy to find online and on a compact disc, however I had overwritten some of the code for new analyses and I could not find the exact code to replicate the published results. I managed to adumbrate the key figure from the original analysis, although the Bayesian credible intervals were noticeably narrower for the trend, which may be because of a difference in the parameter that controlled the non-linearity of the trend. The estimates of the seasonal patterns were similar, but not identical, and this could be due to my ambiguous description in the original paper of how additional seasonal components were added.}
